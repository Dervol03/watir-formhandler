module Watir

  # The OptionGroup represents the parent node of any grouped checkboxes or radio buttons. Its
  # purpose is to provide a way to select different options in a more natural way, like the user
  # would do it: instead of going through all checkboxes one by one and setting them to 'true',
  # OptionGroup allows to specify the option names that are desired to be opted in.
  # @example
  #   group = browser.option
  class OptionGroup < HTMLElement
    # Allows selector to be an HTMLElement, in which case the internal element will be set to this
    # HTMLElement node.
    def initialize(parent, selector)
      stripped_selector = selector.respond_to?(:selector) ? selector.selector : selector
      super parent, stripped_selector

      @element = selector if selector.respond_to?(:selector)
    end
  end
end
